Viola Jones Algorithm 

- Foundation for OpenCV. 
- Developed in 2001 
- Is of two stages. Training and Detection 

Detection stage 
- 1st step is change into grayscale. since it is easier for processing
- VJ algo starts looking for the face 
- Looks for features in pixels.
- it keeps looking for facial features such as eyebrows and eyes to verify it's a face. it keeps iterating forward and then downwards 
- keeps checking for eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth. once these are detected, it shows a high potential for it to be a face
