Single Shot Detection (SSD)
- break down the images into objects where there is a high probability of an object occurring . looking at the gradients and color composition 
- above method would sacrifice accuracy by missing some objects sometimes 
- in SSD, images are looked at once. 
- Image undergoes many convolutions to reduce image size

Multi Box Concept 

- Ground truth - seperates truth from inferred concepts
- SSD breaks picture into segments and every segment will have multiple boxes covered around it
- for every single box, it is validated if there is an object present
