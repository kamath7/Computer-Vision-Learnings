Single Shot Detection (SSD)
- break down the images into objects where there is a high probability of an object occurring . looking at the gradients and color composition 
- above method would sacrifice accuracy by missing some objects sometimes 
- in SSD, images are looked at once. 
- Image undergoes many convolutions to reduce image size

Multi Box Concept 

- Ground truth - seperates truth from inferred concepts
- SSD breaks picture into segments and every segment will have multiple boxes covered around it
- for every single box, it is validated if there is an object present 
- once these boxes predict something, convolutional neural network searches for humans and predicts and at the end there would be an error 
- err would be backpropogated and weights would be updated such that false positive boxes don't predict
- each box can be taken as a separate image and cnn tries to check if there is a human and the error is calculated. in the end aggregated error is then calculated 

Object Positions Predictions 

- when training the SSDs, the ground truth is already known 
- whatever the box predicts will be compared to the ground truth and the error will be calculated 
- the error is then propagated for the back propagation process to begin to update the weights
